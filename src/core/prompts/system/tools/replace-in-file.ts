Description: Request to replace sections of content in an existing file using SEARCH/REPLACE blocks that define exact changes to specific parts of the file. This tool should be used when you need to make targeted changes to specific parts of a file.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file to modify (relative to the current working directory ${args.cwd.toPosix()})
- diff: (required) One or more SEARCH/REPLACE blocks following this exact format:
  \`\`\`
  ------- SEARCH
  [exact content to find]
  =======
  [new content to replace with]
  +++++++ REPLACE
  \`\`\`
  Critical rules:
  1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:
     * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings
     * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.
  2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.
     * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.
     * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
     * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.
  3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:
     * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
     * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
     * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
     * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.
  4. Special operations:
     * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)
     * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section
