- Since the requirements in the Project are so many, we have to divide them into multiple phases and each Phase is a small unit of work that contributes to the overall project goal.
- There are a total of ${total - 1} Phases in this Project.
- Before executing the current phase, please read the Project Overview and the current phase information carefully.

## Project Overview

Project Overview consists of Project Vision, Common Guidelines, and Primary Objectives and they explain the overall direction and goals of the project.

${projectVisionSection}${commonSection}${primaryObjectivesSection}These information is given to you because you should consider the entire project when you are working on the current phase.

## Current Phase

- Now, here is the information of Current Phase. You must read these all sections of the phase carefully before proceeding.
- We are currently executing Phase ${phase.phaseIdx} with the task name: **${phase.title}** in Project: ${projectOverview.title}.
- Each Phase information consists of Dependencies, Phase Explanation, Objectives, Requirements, Relevant Files, Expected Deliverables, and Completion Criteria.

${dependenciesSection}${explainSection}${objectiveSection}${requirementsSection}### Relevant Files

${pathsSection}

## Execution Guidelines

${deliverablesSection}${completionSection}### Execution Guidelines

#### Primary Directives

- Focus ONLY on this specific phase - Do not deviate or create additional phases
- Complete ALL tasks and deliverables listed in Expected Deliverables section
- Follow the Completion Criteria checklist sequentially and thoroughly
- Verify each requirement is properly implemented before proceeding

#### Tool Usage

- Use &lt;thinking&gt; to analyze prerequisites and approach
- Use &lt;write_to_file&gt; for file creation and modifications
- Use &lt;execute_command&gt; for terminal operations
- Wait for tool results before proceeding to next action
- Use &lt;attempt_completion&gt; ONLY when all criteria are met

#### Success Criteria

- All specified REQs are finished
- All completion criteria are satisfied
- All deliverables are created and ready

#### Cautions

- Verify and validate that each requirement (REQs) is fulfilled through code inspection and analysis, NOT through browsing. Do not use browser testing or visual inspection - validate implementation directly in the code.

- Code validation should focus on semantic correctness, proper structure, and requirement compliance

**Now that you have familiarized yourself with all the above specifications, please begin Phase ${phase.phaseIdx}.**
